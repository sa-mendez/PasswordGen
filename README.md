# PasswordGen

This is a command line random passphrase generator that I implemented both for practical use, and more importantly as an exercise in learning how to write a full fledged Haskell program including the use of Monads, Monad Transformers, and various Haskell API methods.

It requires using an english and spanish dictionary file, but also supports symbols and numbers in the passpharse generation.

Its crazy how much effort it took to write such little (but elegant) code.  But I guess that is why Haskell appeals to me.  Feel free to use, extend, break, learn from it, etc.
